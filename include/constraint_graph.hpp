/**
 * \brief Structure to represent a graph with constraints
 * on choice of disparities for pixels (constraint satisfaction problem, CSP).
 *
 * \section csp-problem-statement Statement of the problem
 *
 * After optimization performed on DisparityGraph,
 * it's needed to choose one labeling of many others
 * that satisfy constraints of the problem.
 *
 * Assuming the \f$\mathbb{I}\f$ to be an indicator function,
 * we have the following formulas to set initial constraints for nodes
 *
 * \f[
 *  b_i\left( d \right)
 *  = \mathbb{I}\left(
 *      q_i\left( d; \varphi \right)
 *      - \min\limits_{\delta \in D}{q_i\left( \delta; \varphi \right)}
 *      \le \varepsilon
 *  \right),
 *  \quad i \in I,
 *  \quad d \in D
 * \f]
 *
 * and edges
 *
 * \f[
 *  a_{ij}\left( d, d' \right)
 *  = \mathbb{I}\left(
 *      g_{ij}\left( d, d'; \varphi \right)
 *      - \min\limits_{\left\langle \delta, \delta' \right\rangle \in D^2}{
 *          g_{ij}\left( \delta, \delta'; \varphi \right)}
 *      \le \varepsilon
 *  \right),
 *  \quad i \in I,
 *  \quad j \in N_i,
 *  \quad \left\langle d, d' \right\rangle \in D^2.
 * \f]
 *
 * The problem is to find a disparity map,
 * for which all constraints are satisfied,
 * i. e., all nodes contained in the disparity map exist
 * and neighbors are connected by existent edges.
 *
 * There are cases when the constraint satisfaction problem.
 * One of these cases is ours.
 *
 * \section csp-solution Solution
 *
 * It's easy to solve the problem in our case
 * in iterative maneer.
 * Let's note initial availability of nodes \f$b^0\f$
 * and initial availability of edges \f$a^0\f$.
 * They're already defined.
 *
 * Iteration of the algorithm is following
 *
 * - Take each node.
 *  If the node is unavailable, it will never become available.
 *  Otherwise,
 *  check whether in each neighbor of pixel of the node
 *  there exists an available edge between at least one node of the pixel
 *  and current node.
 *  If there is no connection with at least one neighboring pixel,
 *  the node becomes unavailable.
 * - Take each edge.
 *  If the edge is unavailable, it will never become available.
 *  Otherwise,
 *  check whether both nodes of the edge are available.
 *  If at least one node is unavailable,
 *  the edge becomes unavailable.
 *
 * \f[
 *  \begin{cases}
 *      b^{k + 1}_i\left( d \right)
 *      = b^k_i\left( d \right)
 *          \wedge
 *              \bigwedge\limits_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i}
 *              \bigvee\limits_{d' \in D} a^k_{ij}\left( d, d' \right),
 *      \quad \forall i \in I,
 *      \quad \forall d \in D,
 *      \\
 *      a^{k + 1}_{ij}\left( d, d' \right)
 *      = a^k_{ij}\left( d, d' \right)
 *          \wedge b_i\left( d \right)
 *          \wedge b_j\left( d' \right),
 *      \quad \forall i \in I,
 *      \quad \forall j \in N_i,
 *      \quad \forall \left\langle d, d' \right\rangle \in D^2.
 *  \end{cases}
 * \f]
 *
 * Iteration is an execution of the step for all nodes and edges.
 *
 * If available nodes stay available
 * and available edges stay available after the \f$k\f$th iteration,
 * the algorighm is finished.
 * Otherwise, go to \f$k + 1\f$st iteration.
 *
 * \section csp-memory Memory usage
 *
 * \subsection memory-issue Issue
 *
 * Number of edges is approximately
 *
 * \f[
 *  \left| a \right|
 *  \approx \left| I \right|
 *  \cdot \max\limits_{i \in I}\left| \mathcal{N}_i \right|
 *  \cdot \left| D \right|^2
 * \f]
 *
 * This means, that for 1Mpx image \f$2^{10} \times 2^{10}\f$
 * with maximal disparity equal to \f$128 = 2^7\f$
 * and four neighbors (::NEIGHBORS_COUNT)
 * number of edges is
 *
 * \f[
 *  \left| a \right|
 *  \approx \left( 2^{10} \right)^2 \cdot 4 \cdot \left( 2^7 \right)^2
 *  = 2^{20} \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^{14}
 *  = 2^{36}
 *  \approx 64 \cdot 10^9
 * \f]
 *
 * Number of reparametrizetion elements under the same conditions is
 *
 * \f[
 *  \left| \varphi \right|
 *  \approx \left| I \right|
 *  \cdot \max\limits_{i \in I}\left| \mathcal{N}_i \right|
 *  \cdot \left| D \right|
 *  = \left( 2^{10} \right)^2 \cdot 4 \cdot 2^7
 *  = 2^{20} \cdot 2^2 \cdot 2^7
 *  = 2^{29}
 *  \approx 0.5 \cdot 10^9
 * \f]
 *
 * If we use 4-byte floating point numbers
 * for DisparityGraph::reparametrization,
 * the DisparityGraph will cost \f$\approx\f$ 2GB.
 * If we store information about availability of each edge in a single bit,
 * memory consumption of the ConstraintGraph will be \f$\approx\f$ 8GB.
 *
 * It's problematic to store the last one,
 * not speaking about parallel solution of different CSPs,
 * because each instance should have its own copy of ConstraintGraph.
 *
 *
 * \subsection memory-issue-solution Solution
 *
 * We can avoid usage of edge availability markers.
 * In the problem above, usage of node availability is
 *
 * \f[
 *  \left| b \right|
 *  \approx \left| I \right| \cdot \left| D \right|
 *  = 2^{10} \cdot 2^7
 *  = 2^{17}
 *  \approx 128 \cdot 10^3
 * \f]
 *
 * Even if we will use 8 bytes per value,
 * nodes' availability array will consume less than a megabyte
 * of memory.
 *
 * We know, that unavailable edge will never become available.
 * It may be unavailable for two reasons:
 *
 * -# It has failed comparison with \f$\varepsilon\f$;
 * -# One of its node is/became unavailable.
 *
 * Thus, we can use the formula
 *
 * \f[
 *  a^{k + 1}_{ij}\left( d, d' \right)
 *  = \mathbb{I}\left(
 *    g_{ij}\left( d, d'; \varphi \right)
 *    - \min\limits_{\left\langle \delta, \delta' \right\rangle \in D^2}{
 *        g_{ij}\left( \delta, \delta'; \varphi \right)}
 *    \le \varepsilon
 *  \right)
 *  \wedge b^k_i\left( d \right)
 *  \wedge b^k_j\left( d' \right).
 * \f]
 *
 * Now, the formula for computation of
 * \f$a^{k + 1}_{ij}\left( d, d' \right)\f$
 * doesn't depend directly on \f$a^k\f$
 *
 * \f[
 *  b^{k + 1}_i\left( d \right)
 *  = b^k_i\left( d \right)
 *      \wedge \bigwedge\limits_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i} \bigvee\limits_{d' \in D}
 *          b^k_j\left( d' \right)
 *          \wedge \mathbb{I}\left(
 *            g_{ij}\left( d, d'; \varphi \right)
 *            - \min\limits_{
 *              \left\langle \delta, \delta' \right\rangle \in D^2}{
 *              g_{ij}\left( \delta, \delta'; \varphi \right)}
 *            \le \varepsilon
 *          \right).
 * \f]
 *
 * We can easily precompute each
 * \f$\min\limits_{\left\langle \delta, \delta' \right\rangle \in D^2}
 * {g_{ij}\left( \delta, \delta'; \varphi \right)}\f$:
 * there are \f$4 \cdot \left| I \right|\f$ of them
 * (one for each pair of neighboring pixels).
 * In this case,
 * computation of initial availability for an edge
 * will cost almost only computation of its penalty.
 *
 * It's needed to store a pointer to a DisparityGraph in ConstraintGraph
 * to use ::edge_penalty.
