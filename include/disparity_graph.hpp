/**
 * \brief Structure to represent a graph of MRF
 * (Markov random field) for MAP (maximal a posteriory) problem
 * of stereo vision.
 *
 * Let's call width of images \f$w\f$ and height \f$h\f$,
 * introduce sets \f$X = \left\{ 1, \dots, w \right\}\f$
 * and \f$Y = \left\{ 1, \dots, h \right\}\f$,
 * and available grayscale colors
 * \f$C = \left\{ 1, \dots, \max\left( C \right) \right\}\f$.
 * For convenience, we'll define \f$I = X \times Y\f$.
 * One element of the index set \f$I\f$ can be written as
 *
 * \f[
 *  I \ni i = \left\langle i^x, i^y \right\rangle
 * \f]
 *
 * We can represent images as mappings
 *
 * \f[
 *  L: I \rightarrow C \\
 *  R: I \rightarrow C \\
 * \f]
 *
 * Disparity is a difference
 * between number of a column of a pixel of the left image
 * and number of a column of corresponding pixel of the right image.
 * Given maximal disparity \f$d\f$ and denoting
 * \f$D = \left\{ 1, \dots, d \right\}\f$,
 * correspondence function is called labeling and its signature is
 *
 * \f[
 *  k: I \rightarrow D
 * \f]
 *
 * Thus, given an index \f$i_R\f$ of a pixel on the right image
 * and specific \f$k\f$ mapping,
 * we can find an index of corresponding pixel of the left image
 * by the formula
 *
 * \f[
 *  i_L = \left\langle i_R^x + k_{i_R}, i_R^y \right\rangle
 * \f]
 *
 * Set of all neighbors of a pixel will be noted \f$\mathcal{N}_i\f$.
 * Set with right and buttom neighbors
 * will be noted \f$N_i\f$.
 * The last one is empty for the right bottom pixel,
 * contains only one element for pixels
 * located on the right column or on the bottom row.
 *
 * The problem is to find such \f$k\f$
 * that minimizes the following function
 * given a norm \f$\left\| \cdot \right\|\f$
 * and positive \f$p \in \mathbb{R}\f$
 *
 * \f[
 *  E\left( k \right) =
 *  \sum\limits_{i \in I} \left\|
 *      R\left( i^x, i^y \right)
 *      - L\left( i^x + k_i, i^y \right)
 *  \right\|^p
 *  + \sum\limits_{i \in I} \sum\limits_{j \in N_i}
 *      \left\| k_i - k_j \right\|^p
 * \f]
