 * \brief Input and output operations for PGM image format.
 *
 * The class allows to read and write sp::image::Image
 * from stream that contains image in
 * <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html">"plain" PGM</a>
 * and write it to stream in this format.
 *
 * The structure is very simple.
 * All chunks of information are separated by whitespace
 * (space, tab or new line).
 * Let's call one chunk an \b instruction.
 * All instructions except comments and the first instruction
 * are regular ASCII numbers.
 * Comments start with `#` character
 * and go to the end of the line where the symbol occurs.
 * PGM file contains the following instructions in the following order:
 *
 * - Two magic characters: `P2`;
 * - Two numbers:
 *   width (number of columns) and height (number of rows);
 * - Maximum gray value;
 * - List of intensities in row-major order.
